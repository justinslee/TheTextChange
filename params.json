{"name":"The TextChange","tagline":"Repository for TheTextChange","body":"### Welcome to The TextChange\r\nThis open source project is aimed at creating a textbook trading online environment that caters to UH ICS students to save money.  \r\n\r\n### Functionality\r\nIt has a basic user greeting screen, a navbar to change pages, and an administrator page.  The current functionality is mostly within an administrative interface that allows the admin to add, update, edit, or delete students, books, offers, and requests.  \r\n\r\n### Current Development\r\nOne item in development is the login authentication using the UH Web Login with the system.  A functional PHP code has been developed to authenticate UH students, but the Play Framework doesn't support it.  Instead a JavaScript version of the code is still in development.  The search function is also being developed so users can see who is offering or requesting books.  \r\n\r\n### Future Development\r\nFuture development will include an online version running on CloudBees, substantial error handling, robust application security, and updates to the code and interface.  \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
